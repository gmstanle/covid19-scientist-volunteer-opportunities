# COVID-19 Volunteer/Donation Opportunities for Scientists

## Intro

This table is intended for qualified scientists and technicians to find volunteer or material donation opportunities for the COVID-19 pandemic. Please only sign up if you believe you have the requested expertise or materials that the forms indicate to avoid overwhelming these groups with information they cannot use. I'm not affiliated with any of these groups, but am compiling these from links I find. If you have any links to add, please contact Geoff Stanley (me) at gmstanle@stanford.edu. I'll be adding links as I find them.
